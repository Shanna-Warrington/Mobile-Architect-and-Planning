# Mobile-Architect-and-Planning

Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The app is focused on inventory for small businesses and new entrepreneurs. The base version will allow the user to add, update, delete and view the inventory. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

I started with a basic login screen that all users of apps will find easy to navigate. From there it takes the user to the main page which shows all of the inventory currently in the app. This page has the ability to search the current items as well as add, delete, or update by navigating using the buttons on the bottom of the screen.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

My process for coding was to first separate the task into smaller goals. Instead of trying to code the whole thing from start to finish, I focused on each page separately and then combined the pages to work together.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I did a basic test by running the app through an emulator. This let me see how it would run for the user on their device.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

The planning and designing were the most enjoyable for myself. It was the coding to make the pages and buttons do what was needed that was a challenge for me.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I believe the UI component was where my skills came out. While it is a basic design, I feel that I considered how the user would interact with the app.
